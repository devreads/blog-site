                <p>Have you ever tried to start a hotspot in Windows 10, so your mobile phone can use the internet connection of the PC or laptop but failed to do so? This article shows you how to fix the hotspot not starting issue and related problems that Windows users have commonly encountered.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1e6p8bpla7">What is a hosted network?</h2>
<p>Hosted network feature is first introduced with Windows 7. It allows the user to create a virtual wireless hotspot (like in your phone) without any additional software. But it is required to have a supported wireless adapter to enable this feature. In some cases, wireless adapter is supported but required drivers are not installed. Either case, follow our guide below to resolve this error.</p>
<h5 id="mcetoc_1e6p82nsr5"><strong>Check internet connection in PC</strong></h5>
<p>If you are using a mobile broadband dongle which usually connected to the USB port, first make sure it is connected and internet is working properly in PC.</p>
<h5 id="mcetoc_1e6p82si26"><br><strong>Check if your wireless adapter supports hosted networks. </strong></h5>
<p><br>In some cases your wireless adapter might not have the support for hosted network, and that can cause this problem to appear. To check if your adapter supports hosted networks, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start Command Prompt as administrator.</li>
<li>When Command Prompt opens, execute below
<pre>netsh wlan show driver | findstr Hosted</pre>
</li>
<li>Check the value for "Hosted network supported" option. Hosted network support shows no? It means your network adapter doesn’t support this feature.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dkiivbrd1">How to fix hosted network not supported?</h2>
<p>Hosted network not supported means, your wireless driver is not supporting that feature or related drivers are not installed. If its the later case, you can resolve it by<br>updating wireless adapter drivers.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center" ><img src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/10/hosted-network-could-not-be-started-driver-1.jpg" alt="Update driver from device manager" width="399" height="343">
<figcaption >Update driver from device manager </figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dkij2bn43">What to do if hosted network is not supported?</h2>
<p>You can try the "No Wifi" app described below or buy an external USB wifi adapter with hosted network support. These TP-Link and Edimax USB wifi adapters are the best we have came across on Amazon. (<em>Note: As an Amazon Associate we may earn a small commission from these product recommendations.</em>)</p>

<script src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US"></script>
<p>If the "Hosted network supported" shows no even after the driver update, you can use "<strong>No wifi</strong>" app to create a mobile hotspot. Install "<strong>No wifi</strong>" app from Microsoft store (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NK0DST7HZX5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NK0DST7HZX5</a>) and run. This app uses an alternative method to setup wifi hotspots which is not used by the builtin hotspot.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1dkij9te48">Hosted network, no internet access in windows 10?</h2>
<p>Wifi hotspot is setup but no internet yet? Or mobile phone is failed to obtain an IP address? Then follow the steps below to check whether the internet sharing is correctly linked with the hotspot adapter.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Mobile hotspot settings (Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Mobile hotspot) Turn on mobile hotspot</li>
<li>Under "Related Settings", click Change adapter options</li>
<li>Take note of which adapter is connected to the internet and which adapter is your mobile hotspot (typically named "<strong>Local Area Connection* [#]</strong>")</li>
<li>Right click the adapter that is connected to the internet and click <strong>Properties</strong></li>
<li>Go to the Sharing tab</li>
<li>Uncheck "<strong>Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection</strong>". If it is already unchecked, skip this step, Click OK</li>
<li>Again, open Properties &gt; Sharing for the same adapter.</li>
<li>Check "<strong>Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection</strong>"</li>
<li>If you get a popup that says "Internet Connection Sharing is currently enabled...", click OK.</li>
<li>Under "Home networking connection:", select the mobile hotspot adapter, click OK</li>
</ol>

                <p>It is often required to convert a java List to an Array or wise versa. In this article we discuss few methods of doing the List to Array conversion.</p>
<p>Java List interface provides methods to interact with collection of objects which duplicates are allowed. java.util.list is a child interface of the java.util.collection interface where java.util.list is implemented in ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector and Stack classes. List interface allows adding, removing, getting and setting values in List objects. Our main focus here is how to convert list to array in java. Below are few example methods of converting a list to array.</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1e19b7ft30">1. List interface's built in method toArray() for converting List to Array of String</h4>
<p>

</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1e19ds9na4"> </h4>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1e19c22041">2. Stream API (Since Java 8)</h4>
<p>With the introduction of streams in java 8, it is more than easier to convert List to array in java. First it has to stream the list with List.stream() method then Stream.toArray() can be used to return an Array object containing items from the original list.</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1e19dn4fb3">

</h4>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1e19dsdpb6"> </h4>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1e19dsdhl5">3. Using Guava library</h4>
<p>Guava library provides methods for converting a List to Array using Iterables class.</p>

<p>Bite this. Here we are throwing the secret right away :)</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: We are not affiliated with this company in anyway or won't get any kind of revenue (but we would like to 😊) by sharing this app. We just ❤️ the idea behind this and totally impressed after trying it ourselves.</em></p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1dh9mn4la0">Zero Code</h2>
<p>With Glide, you don't have to write a single code for creating a mobile app. That is a great advantage for start-up founders who does not have much coding knowledge, but having an awesome idea for an app. </p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dh9n9mud3">No Database</h2>
<p>Best feature of Glide is, it does not require a complex database system to store app's data. Instead it uses <a href="https://sheets.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google sheets</a> so anyone having a Google account can link a sheet to the app. Then just insert some data to the sheet and it will magically appear in the mobile app. This is a huge advantage for non techie users.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dh9ngvhf4">Ready made app templates</h2>
<p>Glide app comes with about a dozen templates that you can use right away. Those are <span style="font-weight: 400;">beautifully </span>crafted for the best user experience and easy customization. Just pick an app template and click on the Copy app button to get a copy of that to your workspace. Few of those templates are a Directory app, City guide app, CRM app, budget planner and even a personal Instagram app. </p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1dh9n3m812">Hosted</h2>
<p>Apps build with Glide are already hosted under a glide subdomain. So you can share the app url right away with the users. But if you want to use your own url, then you have to pay and subscribe to their pro plan.</p>
<p><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/8/pricing.PNG" alt="" width="717" height="501"></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dh9ob6cj1">Great documentation</h2>
<p>What impressed us most (next to Google sheet integration) was their <a href="https://www.glideapps.com/learn-to-glide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a>. It has a large collection of video clips showing how to get things done with Glide. That's quite useful for newbies who doesn't have much technical knowledge to browse through tech documentation. But there is also a detailed documentation wiki available for anyone who wants to try their advanced features right inside the workspace. </p>
<p>So that's our guide for the best free app builder found recently in response to our user requests. We hope you give it a try for your next project. </p>
<p>PS: Glide has been featured on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/glide-67aa7482-4698-4174-911c-f2de1338704b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">producthunt </a>as product of the day and got many upvotes from the community for their great idea.</p>

<p>Here are 6 of the biggest names appear in Google with one or more "offerings" that I'm going to explain later.</p>

</div>
<p><br>Lets see what are the catches of above services when you go with one of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Build the website for free, but you have to pay for a custom domain name.<br>This is the most common catch. They present you with a feature rich and easy to use website builder. Once you build a website, you can even host it for free and they give a domain name too. But that domain name is not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="TLD (Top Level Domain)">TLD (Top Level Domain)</a>. Instead a subdomain under their brand. If you want to connect a custom domain, then you have to pay.<br><br></li>
<li>Build the website for free, but hosting is not free.<br>These services allow you to create a website quickly but then you have to subscribe to one of their plans to host your site. Otherwise you can just download your site and host somewhere else.<br><br></li>
<li>Limited features or website with their branding<br>You can build a website with limited features. During the making of website, they remind you of some cool features that you can use if you had their "Premium" plan. Even after you can continue to host it and attach your own domain, but they will add their branding and back-links to their main website in your sites footer, sidebar or anywhere others can see.<br><br></li>
<li>Limited bandwidth, requests per month, number of pages and many more limitations.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1dgi6aajf0"> Then how can I build and run my own website for free?</h4>
<p>First lets see the ingredients you want to run the website.</p>
<ol>
<li>Website builder (If you don't know coding or don't want, instead want to focus more on content and business)</li>
<li>Domain name</li>
<li>Hosting</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have all of the above 3 for free of charge, then you have a free website. Now I will explain each of the above in details. Actually there are many ways to obtain each of that. But here I'm explaining a working and proven method with tools that I have personally tried and <span style="font-weight: 400;">successfully </span>published a website.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dgi6sl381">Free website builder</h2>
<p>There are many free website builders, some are online and some are offline to install and run on your computer. Out of many free website builders that I have tried, I found that <a href="https://getpublii.com" title="Open-Source CMS for Static Site" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Publii </a>is the most <span style="font-weight: 400;">promising </span>software. It supports MacOs, Windows and Linux computers. Also It is a fully open source and free software that you can install without any doubt. So go ahead, download it from this link. <a href="https://getpublii.com/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Download Publii">Download Publii</a>. When the download is complete double-click on the downloaded file to run the installer.<br><br>Once the installation is done, Publii will start automatically. For future use, a shortcut will be added to the desktop if you're using Windows, or to the Launchpad on Mac so you'll have easy access to Publii next time around. When Publii is launched for the first time you can see the following screen, where you can setup your website that we are going to launch for FREE.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/creating-new-website.svg" alt="Create Your First Website" width="748" height="498.906"></p>
<p>Select an icon, website name (this is not the domain name) and author name to start the creation of the website. Then you can select a theme from the settings menu, after that you are ready to create articles or posts. Just go through the software and I'm pretty sure you will catch up with its features quickly. It is a neatly designed software with non tech users in mind; you can always refer to <a href="https://getpublii.com/docs/" title="Publii's documentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Publii's documentation</a> which covers almost all the things it can do in simple terms.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dgkorn7d0">Free hosting for the website</h2>
<p>Now we need some place to host our website. There are many free hosting providers supported by Publii including Github pages, Amazon S3, Google cloud, Gitlab. But my favourite is <a href="https://www.netlify.com" title="Netlify: All-in-one platform for automating modern web projects">Netlify</a>. Even though they have pricing for some premium plans, their free plan is more than enough for our website.</p>
<p><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/pricing.PNG" alt="Netlify pricing" width="1147" height="656"></p>
<ol>
<li>First thing is signing up. Go to <a href="https://app.netlify.com/signup">https://app.netlify.com/signup</a> and create an account. Once you created the account, login to Netlify. Now you'll see the <strong>Your Sites</strong> screen, which should be empty since we haven't created a site yet!<br><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/netlify-dashboard-md.png" alt="" width="748" height="272"></li>
<li>Until we create our real website, it is required to create a dummy website in Netlify, so we can continue with our other configurations. Publii provides a sample website (which only contains an empty page) for this purpose. Download it from this <a href="https://cdn.getpublii.com/others/index.html.zip" title="Sample website">link</a> and drag and drop this zip file to Netlify's <strong>Your Sites</strong> screen. Now Netlify will create a site for you.</li>
<li>Now click on the site's name to go inside its settings, you will see a subdomain like in the picture below. Copy that link and paste in a notepad.<br><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/netlify-website-settings-md.png" alt="" width="748" height="422"></li>
<li>Click on <strong>Site Settings</strong> button, then scroll little bit down to see something like below. Copy that <strong>API ID</strong> and paste it in a notepad. We will need it later.<br><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/netlify-site-id-md.png" alt="" width="748" height="241"></li>
<li>Now click on your profile icon on the upper right corner, then click on <strong>User settings</strong>.</li>
<li>Scroll down to <strong>New access token</strong> button and click on it.<br><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/new-token.PNG" alt="" width="1273" height="500"></li>
<li>Give a name and click <strong>Generate token</strong>. Netlify will give you a long random character token. Copy this and keep it in the same notepad like before.<br><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/generate-token.PNG" alt="" width="917" height="476"><br><br>We are done for the moment with Netlify. Now let's go and grab a free domain.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dgi8mo7t0">Free domain name</h2>
<p>This is one of the hardest to find for free. But as I promised in the start of the article, I will show the correct way to obtain a free domain.</p>
<p>There is a service offering FREE domain names for anyone. Not only one but 5 Top Level Domain names. That service is <a href="http://www.freenom.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="freenom - A Name for Everyone">freenom</a>. They offer .TK / .ML / .GA / .CF / .GQ domain names free for unlimited period of time !!!</p>

</div>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">Freenom is the world's first and only free domain provider. Our mission is to bring people online and help countries develop their digital economy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the freenom website from this link <a href="https://www.freenom.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="freenom">https://www.freenom.com</a>, then search for your required domain name. Pick one (or all) of the domain names and click on "Get it now" button(s). Finally click <strong>Checkout</strong>.<br><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/freenom.PNG" alt="Freenom domain search" width="1347" height="651"></li>
<li>Now click on "<strong>Forward this domain</strong>" button and paste the website url you copied from Nelify (in step 3) to the text box. Also select the period as 12 Months. That is the maximum allowed period for one time. But don't worry, you can again renew it before it expires for another 12 months.<br><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/netlify-4.PNG" alt="Forward domain" width="1144" height="528"></li>
<li>In the next screen, enter your email address and follow the registration process. Then you will have your new domain ready.<br><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/freenom-checkout.PNG" alt="Register domain" width="1183" height="564"></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dgksec321">Wiring it all together</h2>
<p>Now we need to connect everything together; Domain to hosting, hosting to Publii, Publii to domain. Then you will have your site ready. Follow me with the final steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Publii and click on the Server option in the left-sidebar to open the Server Settings screen.</li>
<li>Set the domain as what you have registered from Freenom.</li>
<li>From Protocol dropdown, select Netlify</li>
<li>Enter the API ID (copied at step 4 of Netlify registration) of your Netlify site into the Site ID field.</li>
<li>Enter the Netlify token we created (at step 5) in the Netlify token field, and click the Save settings button to save changes.<br><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/netlify-static-website-configuration.svg" alt="Publii configurations" width="748" height="392.832"></li>
<li>Now click on the <strong>Test connection</strong> button to see if everything is working. If that's ok you can start creating your website. </li>
<li>Once you are done with creating some posts, click on <strong>Sync your website</strong> button to publish the site. It will take some time. Once the Publii shows it's done, hit your domain name on browser and see your zero cent website !!!.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's all folks. But there are many things you can do with Publii / Netlify / Freenom combination. I will later post on how to do other configurations like proper dns configurations, forwarding www domain, Enabling Google analytics, Google ad sense and many more. This post is a starter guide for anyone to start with their own site without spending money. Share this article if you found it useful. </p>

It was critical to find the issue and fixing it soon, as this CPU utilization affected other applications on the same server. So I’m going to explain the methodology that we used to find and fix this issue.</p>

<p><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/5/Java_high_CPU_40_80-300x157.png" alt="High CPU utilization of a process" width="300" height="157"></p>
<p class="msg msg--info">Environment<br>Sun Solaris Server – 12 cores</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dfttpktn3">Finding the process</h2>
<p>We have used <code>top</code> command to get the most CPU utilizing applications. Since the server had 12 cores, it showed total CPU utilization by all cores. But once disabled the <em>Irix mode</em> (pressing ‘<strong>I</strong>’) we got the average CPU per process. Then obtained the PID of the most CPU utilizing the process.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>Irix/Solaris_Mode_toggle</strong><br>When operating in 'Solaris mode' ('I' toggled Off), a task's CPU usage will be divided by the total number of CPUs. After issuing this command, you'll be informed of the new state of this toggle.</p>
<p><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/5/Process-cpu-utilization-768x115.jpg" alt="&quot;top&quot; command to find high CPU process" width="768" height="115"></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dfttseju4">Finding the thread</h2>
<p>Once the PID of the process is obtained, used ‘<strong>H</strong>’ key to list the threads of that process. Then obtained the <em>NID</em> or ‘<em>Soft process Id</em>’ from the first column.</p>
<p><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/5/thread-wise-cpu-utilization-768x88.jpg" alt="FInd the process ID" width="768" height="88"></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dfttsnh75">Get the thread dump</h2>
<p>Used the following command to obtain a thread dump of the JVM process identified in step 1.</p>
<p><code>jstack -l PID &gt; jstack.txt</code></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dftttgns6">Isolate the stack trace</h2>
<p>Inside the thread dump file, it had the stack trace of each thread. But most important thing is identifying the correct stack trace. For each stack trace, there was a <em>NID </em>field in HEX format which is equivalent to the thread id obtained in step 2. Once the thread id is <a href="https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">converted to HEX</a>, we have isolated the stack trace.</p>
<p><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/5/stack-trace-768x242.jpg" alt="Isolate the stack trace" width="768" height="242"></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dftttqht7">Find the culprit code block</h2>
<p>From the stack trace, we have identified the code block which was executed with 100% CPU. In our case, it was a while loop which entered into an infinite cycle when certain condition met.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dfttu35o8">Fix it!</h2>
<p>So we have fixed that, tested and deployed to production. Now the JVM process is running smoothly even CPU doesn’t know that 🙂</p>

        <title>How to build an API-Gateway with Netflix Zuul + Spring Boot</title>

                    <p>When you develop applications in microservice architecture, it is often required to route API requests to the respective service(s). Doing this with a general purpose load balancer like nginx or apache was the practice before. But it will take some control away from the application. Also it is important to remember that, maintaining an API-Gateway service brings you more benefits other than load balancing like below.</p>

                <p>When you develop applications in microservice architecture, it is often required to route API requests to the respective service(s). Doing this with a general purpose load balancer like nginx or apache was the practice before. But it will take some control away from the application. Also it is important to remember that, maintaining an API-Gateway service brings you more benefits other than load balancing like below.</p>

<ul>
<li>Authentication and Security</li>
<li>Monitoring</li>
<li>Dynamic Routing</li>
<li>Static Response handling</li>
<li>Rate limiting</li>
</ul>
<p>You can implement all the above features with Spring Boot + Zuul, but this article will only cover <em>how to create your first API-Gateway application</em>. Let's start with an example.</p>
<p><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/3/microservice.png" alt="Microservice architecture" width="1355" height="375"></p>
<p>Here we have multiple services executing their own business logic, so it is up to the <strong>Gateway</strong> to send requests to the correct microservice. This <strong>Gateway</strong> is a layer 7 load balancer which routes requests to the correct microservice based on the information presented in the request url.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Layer 4 load balancer bases the load-balancing decision on the source and destination IP addresses and ports recorded in the packet header, without considering the contents of the packet.</p>
<p>Layer 7 load balancers base their routing decisions on various characteristics of the HTTP header and on the actual contents of the message, such as the URL, the type of data (text, video, graphics), or information in a cookie.</p>
<p>-- <a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/layer-4-load-balancing/" title="Layer 4 vs Layer 7 load balancing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nginx</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dfnd20si0">Netflix Zuul to the rescue </h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/zuul/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zuul </a>is a library developed by Netflix, that provides dynamic routing, monitoring, resiliency, security, and more amazing features. Best thing is Spring Boot has already bundled Zuul with their Spring Cloud dependency. Lets see how we can implement our own API Gateway with <strong>Spring Cloud + Zuul</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate the Spring Boot project. Go to <a href="https://start.spring.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Spring Initializer page">Spring Initializer page</a> and add Zuul as a dependency.</li>
<li style="list-style: none;"><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/3/spring.png" alt="Generating Spring Boot project" width="1156" height="688"></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Download and extract the project.</li>
<li>You just need to add <code>@EnableZuulProxy</code> annotation to the Main class to make this project a Zuul proxy server. Spring Boot will auto configure everything based on this annotation.</li>
<li style="list-style: none;">
<script src="https://gist.github.com/devreads/58a71a9bfd672dadc4fdd97113f0c01d.js"></script>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Now you can configure routing (i.e. Request paths and respective service urls) in the application.properties file.</li>
<li style="list-style: none;">
<script src="https://gist.github.com/devreads/79b4ad3b8d3d1891243fa8c5d392d393.js"></script>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Execute <code>mvn clean install</code> to build the project. Then run it using <code>java –jar &lt;JARFILE&gt;</code>. You will see the API-Gateway is starting to listen on port 8080.</li>
<li>Send two requests to <code>http://localhost:8080/api/service_1/</code> and <code>http://localhost:8080/api/service_2/</code>, you will see requests are routed to service_1 and service_2 respectively as we have configured on application.properties file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Did you see how awesome the Spring Boot and Zuul is, that we can configure an API-Gateway application with just one annotation and couple of configuration entries.</p>

                <p>If you've ever come across a situation to convert your grandfathers' java project  (which he used to build with ant) to maven, you know the pain. Maybe you are reading this because its time to do that. So, here is a definitive guide to doing that without getting lost in the dependency hell (RIP grandpa)</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1df6r7mjd0">Create the directory structure</h2>
<p>Execute the following commands in order to create the standard <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html" title="maven directory structure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maven directory structure</a>.</p>
<h5 id="mcetoc_1df6r7mjd1"><strong>for web apps</strong></h5>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId={project-packaging} \
-DartifactId={project-name} \
-DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp \
-DinteractiveMode=false
</code></pre>
<h5 id="mcetoc_1df6ra8us6"><strong>for standalone apps</strong></h5>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId={project-packaging} \
 -DarchetypeArtifactId=={project-name} \
 -DarchetypeVersion=1.4<br></code></pre>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1df6r7mjd3">Declare dependencies</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Declare the <code>groupId</code>, <code>arifactId</code> and <code>version</code> for the project</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;project&gt;
 &lt;modelVersion&gt; 4.0.0 &lt;/modelVersion&gt;
 &lt;groupId&gt; com.mycompany.app &lt;/groupId&gt;
 &lt;artifactId&gt; my-app &lt;/artifactId&gt;
 &lt;version&gt; 1.0.1 &lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find the dependencies for each jar file linked to the project.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jars having pom.xml files inside</strong> - Extract the <!--code>groupId</code>, <code>arifactId</code> and <code>version</code--> from the pom file.</li>
<li><strong>Jars not having a pom.xml file</strong> - Refer to the signature based artifact search method explained below.</li>
<li><strong>Jars which cannot find using the above 2 methods</strong> - Install to your local maven repository or your companies artifact repository.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mvn install:install-file -Dfile=&lt;path-to-file&gt; -DgroupId=&lt;myGroup&gt; \
 -DartifactId=&lt;myArtifactId&gt; -Dversion=&lt;myVersion&gt; \
 -Dpackaging=jar
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execute <code>mvn clean package</code> to see whether pom has been declared correctly. You can compare the new build against the old build to verify the accuracy of the conversion.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1df6r7mjd4">Signature-based artifact search</h2>
<p>Now we have come into the best part.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are on Windows, download the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/841290/availability-and-description-of-the-file-checksum-integrity-verifier-u" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">File Checksum Integrity Verifier utility</a></strong> from Microsoft site.</li>
<li>Execute the following from command line to generate a <strong>SHA1</strong> signature for the jar file which we need to find.
<h5 id="mcetoc_1df6bnrvb9">For a single jar file</h5>
<pre><code class="language-bash">fciv commons-io-1.3.2.jar -sha1
</code></pre>
<figure class="post__image post__image" ><img src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/1//Capture.PNG" alt="checksum generation with fciv tool" width="524" height="131">
<figcaption >checksum generation using FCIV tool</figcaption>
</figure>
<h5 id="mcetoc_1df6r7mjd5">For a directory of jars</h5>
<pre><code class="language-bash">fciv D:\\path\\to\\jars -type *.jar -sha1
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Go to <a href="https://repository.sonatype.org/" title="Nexus repository manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nexus repository manager</a> and click <strong><strong>Advanced search<br></strong></strong>
<figure class="post__image post__image" ><img src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/1//Capture2.PNG" alt="Nexus repository manager" width="1366" height="621">
<figcaption >Search  Nexus repository using the generated checksum value</figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
<li>Find the matching artifact details using the SHA1 hash obtained from the above step.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you should be able to find all the dependency information refered from old Ant project by this way. So go ahead and get the hands dirty. </p>
<p><em><strong>ps</strong>: I will write another article to show how this whole process can be automated.</em></p>
