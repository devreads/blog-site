                <p>It is often required to convert a java List to an Array or wise versa. In this article we discuss few methods of doing the List to Array conversion.</p>
<p>Java List interface provides methods to interact with collection of objects which duplicates are allowed. java.util.list is a child interface of the java.util.collection interface where java.util.list is implemented in ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector and Stack classes. List interface allows adding, removing, getting and setting values in List objects. Our main focus here is how to convert list to array in java. Below are few example methods of converting a list to array.</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1e19b7ft30">1. List interface's built in method toArray() for converting List to Array of String</h4>

</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1e19ds9na4"> </h4>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1e19c22041">2. Stream API (Since Java 8)</h4>
<p>With the introduction of streams in java 8, it is more than easier to convert List to array in java. First it has to stream the list with List.stream() method then Stream.toArray() can be used to return an Array object containing items from the original list.</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1e19dn4fb3">

</h4>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1e19dsdpb6"> </h4>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1e19dsdhl5">3. Using Guava library</h4>
<p>Guava library provides methods for converting a List to Array using Iterables class.</p>

                <p>As payments are increasingly executed using mobile devices, the infrastructure is changing. As always, a multitude of banking channels, financial services providers, payment processors, and payment networks are jockeying for position in a highly competitive ecosystem. Whether you are designing a fraud detection system or evaluating currently available systems in the market, read this article to discover the important aspects before your big decision.</p>

<p>Network participants must adapt to an increasingly wide variety of payment mechanisms, devices, and types. Not long ago, nearly all payments originated from a relatively small number of point-of-sale terminals. Now payment processors must efficiently handle requests from billions of mobile devices worldwide. These transactions must traverse a complex payment processing network at near real-time speeds.</p>
<p><img class="post__image align-center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/15/Capture2.PNG" alt="Architecture for Modern Payment Processing" width="765" height="392"></p>
<p>Legacy payment processing infrastructure is not optimized for the new tsunami of  transactions. Facing a massive increase in mobile payments and consumer demand for real-time processing, these systems are struggling to keep up with time-sensitive, high-volume data.</p>
<p>Slow processing speeds can frustrate customers and merchants, encouraging them to change payment methods or even vendors. Poor performance also increases the likelihood of potentially costly and catastrophic data processing failures. Large companies that process high volumes of data are especially sensitive to a server or system failure. Downtime can negatively affect user satisfaction and may result in fines, potential regulatory oversight, and a loss of business.</p>
<p>People expect to conduct transactions wherever they are, at any time, using their  mobile devices. However, some payment processing systems lack adequate edge processing capabilities to meet these needs. Scalability can also be a problem, with legacy infrastructures unable to scale to handle traffic bursts. For example, seasonal traffic and peak loads—including spikes that occur during events such as Cyber Monday can overload some systems.</p>
<p>In the payment hub, compute speeds must be exceptionally fast. The solution should include a high performance operational data store for fast lookups, allowing the system to quickly and accurately assess transaction validity. This store cannot be based on disk-based data platforms due to the overhead that negatively impacts latency.</p>
<p><img class="post__image align-center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/15/Capture3.PNG" alt="Focus on Payment Hub Services" width="366" height="391"></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dvj3298n0">Preventing Fraud Is a Balancing Act</h3>
<p>Not only do consumers expect their purchase transactions to be completed without hassles or delays, but they also trust payment processors to protect their accounts, data, and assets from fraud. Yet the increasing volume of online and mobile transactions and payment methods drives up the number of fraud attempts.</p>
<p>Businesses want to protect themselves from fraud, but they must strike the right balance between speed and accuracy. When making a purchase, consumers expect the transaction to be processed in two to three seconds. However, network transit time consumes much of this window, requiring payment processors to complete their part of the transaction within milliseconds.</p>
<p>Accuracy is the other critical objective when processors run checks for verification, authentication, and fraud. In the effort to return results quickly, processors might use simple fraud algorithms, but they frequently return false positives where a transaction is incorrectly flagged as fraudulent. When cardholders are delayed by the return of a false positive, they often switch to a different payment method, such as another card. The merchant still gets the sale, but when the processor’s fraud detection algorithm is too strict, the card-issuing bank often loses the transaction fee.</p>
<p>As a result, today’s payment processors need to turn to more sophisticated fraud algorithms. In many cases, they must rely on multiple fraud algorithms to assess several<br>scores to most accurately predict fraud. This extra processing load requires enhanced performance to stay within service-level agreements and avoid overloading the system.</p>
<p>Even legacy payment processing solutions that work satisfactorily will soon be  overwhelmed by burgeoning workloads and the resulting increases in latency. What’s more, these last-generation solutions offer no competitive advantage or opportunities for innovation. That’s unacceptable in a market that clearly rewards first-movers.</p>
<p>To handle increased volumes and workloads, companies need to modernize payment processing systems. You need solutions that can support the business and meet the industry’s changing technology and consumer requirements—without imposing  unnecessary delays processing backlogs.</p>
<p><img class="post__image align-center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/15/Capture4.PNG" alt="Source: Javelin Research, “False-Positive Card Declines Push Consumers to Abandon Issuers and Merchants,” August 27, 2015" width="353" height="545"></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dvj3bs831">Choose Technology with Essential Functionality</h3>
<p>A real-time payment processing and fraud detection solution should include the following capabilities and features.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Processing speeds at extreme scale</strong>. An operational, in-memory computing platform that manages data using in-memory storage is best to deliver microsecond-level speeds at scale. It also performs parallel execution for fast application speed and supports ultra-low latency.</li>
<li><strong>Real-time processing</strong>. Processing should be integrated with an in-memory data store. This feature helps you process data at the moment it is generated or upon ingestion. It also offers real-time classification and prediction workloads at scale, which is especially important for live transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Modern fraud detection methods</strong>. Solutions should be able to run multiple fraud detection algorithms and use the results to make the most accurate decisions rapidly. High-performance solutions can run multiple algorithms in less than 30 milliseconds, which is one-tenth of the time it takes to blink.</li>
<li><strong>Elastic, seamless scalability</strong>. A solution that can scale up and down without interrupting<br>jobs helps you keep pace with changing workloads. You should be able to upgrade it without delaying task processing to ensure continuous operation.</li>
<li><strong>Low-latency batch and stream processing</strong>. An application-embeddable data processing<br>engine ensures that all tasks are lightning fast. Since the collection of payment transactions is essentially a stream, a powerful stream processing engine can handle the transactions as they are delivered into the system. A complementary batch processing system lets youprocess historical data to leverage it as part of the payment verification and fraud analysis tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Stability</strong>. To be reliable, solutions must always be available for processing. In-memory data replication provides a robust yet performant means of fault tolerance. In the case of a temporary outage of the entire cluster, a hot restart feature helps you get all nodes up and running again quickly without having to reread all data from the original sources.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise-grade security</strong>. As mobile payments introduce many more access points to the processing network, the need for security rises. Authentication and role-based access controls protect data from unauthorized viewers, while encrypted data transmission helps ensure data privacy.</li>
<li><strong>Intuitive manageability</strong>. By providing tools to monitor your system, a management console can help you ensure service-level agreements are met. It also provides the tools needed to troubleshoot problems when they arise, reducing the cost of downtime.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dvj3jnsa2">In-the-Moment Processing Accelerates Time to Results</h3>
<p>A modern, real-time payment processing solution offers valuable benefits across your organization. From a business perspective, the right solution helps you deliver faster responses and improves time to results. Modern technology can ingest, categorize, and process vast amounts of data with ultra-low latency, helping you support continuous intelligence practices. It can also help you process time-sensitive data from numerous sources, where and when it is generated. With this unprecedented speed, you can make faster, smarter business decisions.</p>
<p>The ability to process increased volumes of high-frequency data also gives you the opportunity to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance business insights. You can feed huge data volumes to powerful machine learning models, yielding valuable new correlations and patterns that can be beneficial to your business.</p>
<p>A modern payments processing solution also simplifies technology deployment and operation. A single, lightweight system can elegantly address even the most challenging architectural requirements. By choosing an integration-friendly solution, you can avoid adding further complexity or massive administrative overhead to your environment.</p>
<p>A solution designed for simplicity reduces the cost and complexity associated with multi-component and multi-system architectures. It also lowers your need for multiple skill  sets, simplifying staffing.</p>

                <p>Have you tried to start a hotspot in Windows 10, so your mobile phone can use the internet connection of the PC and failed? This article shows how to <br>fix the hotspot not starting issue and related problems that Windows users have commonly encountered.</p>

<p><strong>Check internet connection in PC</strong></p>
<p>If you are using a mobile broadband dongle which usually connected to the USB port, first make sure it is connected and internet is working properly in PC.<br><br><strong>Check if your wireless adapter supports hosted networks. </strong><br><br>In some cases your wireless adapter might not have the support for hosted network, and that can cause this problem to appear. To check if your adapter supports hosted networks, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start Command Prompt as administrator.</li>
<li>When Command Prompt opens, execute below
<pre>netsh wlan show driver | findstr Hosted</pre>
</li>
<li>Check the value for "Hosted network supported" option. Hosted network support shows no? It means your network adapter doesn’t support this feature.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dkiivbrd1">How to fix hosted network not supported?</h3>
<p>Hosted network not supported means, your wireless driver is not supporting that feature or related drivers are not installed. Either case, you can resolve it by<br>updating wireless adapter drivers.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center" ><img src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/10/hosted-network-could-not-be-started-driver-1.jpg" alt="Update driver from device manager" width="399" height="343">
<figcaption >Update driver from device manager </figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dkij2bn43">What to do if hosted network is not supported?</h3>
<p>If the "Hosted network supported" shows no even after the driver update, you can use "<strong>No wifi</strong>" app to create a mobile hotspot. Install "<strong>No wifi</strong>" app from Microsoft store (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NK0DST7HZX5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NK0DST7HZX5</a>) and run. This app uses an alternative method to setup wifi hotspots which is not used by the builtin hotspot.</p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1dkij9te48">hosted network no internet access windows 10?</h3>
<p>Wifi hotspot is setup but no internet yet? Or mobile phone is failed to obtain an IP address? Then follow the steps below to check whether the internet sharing is correctly linked with the hotspot adapter.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Mobile hotspot settings (Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Mobile hotspot) Turn on mobile hotspot</li>
<li>Under "Related Settings", click Change adapter options</li>
<li>Take note of which adapter is connected to the internet and which adapter is your mobile hotspot (typically named "<strong>Local Area Connection* [#]</strong>")</li>
<li>Right click the adapter that is connected to the internet and click <strong>Properties</strong></li>
<li>Go to the Sharing tab</li>
<li>Uncheck "<strong>Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection</strong>". If it is already unchecked, skip this step, Click OK</li>
<li>Again, open Properties &gt; Sharing for the same adapter.</li>
<li>Check "<strong>Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection</strong>"</li>
<li>If you get a popup that says "Internet Connection Sharing is currently enabled...", click OK.</li>
<li>Under "Home networking connection:", select the mobile hotspot adapter, click OK</li>
</ol>

<p>Bite this. Here we are throwing the secret right away :)</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: We are not affiliated with this company in anyway or won't get any kind of revenue (but we would like to 😊) by sharing this app. We just ❤️ the idea behind this and totally impressed after trying it ourselves.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.glideapps.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glide - Amazing apps from Google sheets</a></p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_MEmyCRBbXM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dh9mn4la0">Zero Code</h2>
<p>With Glide, you don't have to write a single code for creating a mobile app. That is a great advantage for start-up founders who does not have much coding knowledge, but having an awesome idea for an app. </p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dh9n9mud3">No Database</h2>
<p>Best feature of Glide is, it does not require a complex database system to store app's data. Instead it uses <a href="https://sheets.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google sheets</a> so anyone having a Google account can link a sheet to the app. Then just insert some data to the sheet and it will magically appear in the mobile app. This is a huge advantage for non techie users.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dh9ngvhf4">Ready made app templates</h2>
<p>Glide app comes with about a dozen templates that you can use right away. Those are <span style="font-weight: 400;">beautifully </span>crafted for the best user experience and easy customization. Just pick an app template and click on the Copy app button to get a copy of that to your workspace. Few of those templates are a Directory app, City guide app, CRM app, budget planner and even a personal Instagram app. </p>
<p>If the provided samples are not enough, there is a separate page showcasing apps made with glide <em><strong><a href="https://www.glideapps.com/madewithglide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#madewithglide</a></strong></em>.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1dh9mo5b81">Progressive web app (PWA)</h2>
<p>If you haven't heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PWA or Progressive Web Apps</a>, it's kind of a web site with some added features which can give you almost the same feeling as a native app when accessed through a mobile phone browser. They can even launch though the app launcher. </p>

<p>Progressive Web Apps are user experiences that have the reach of the web, and are:</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1dh9n3m812">Hosted</h2>
<p>Apps build with Glide are already hosted under a glide subdomain. So you can share the app url right away with the users. But if you want to use your own url, then you have to pay and subscribe to their pro plan.</p>
<p><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/8/pricing.PNG" alt="" width="717" height="501"></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dh9ob6cj1">Great documentation</h2>
<p>What impressed us most (next to Google sheet integration) was their <a href="https://www.glideapps.com/learn-to-glide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a>. It has a large collection of video clips showing how to get things done with Glide. That's quite useful for newbies who doesn't have much technical knowledge to browse through tech documentation. But there is also a detailed documentation wiki available for anyone who wants to try their advanced features right inside the workspace. </p>
<p>So that's our guide for the best free app builder found recently in response to our user requests. We hope you give it a try for your next project. </p>

<p><br>Lets see what are the catches of above services when you go with one of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Build the website for free, but you have to pay for a custom domain name.<br>This is the most common catch. They present you with a feature rich and easy to use website builder. Once you build a website, you can even host it for free and they give a domain name too. But that domain name is not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="TLD (Top Level Domain)">TLD (Top Level Domain)</a>. Instead a subdomain under their brand. If you want to connect a custom domain, then you have to pay.<br><br></li>
<li>Build the website for free, but hosting is not free.<br>These services allow you to create a website quickly but then you have to subscribe to one of their plans to host your site. Otherwise you can just download your site and host somewhere else.<br><br></li>
<li>Limited features or website with their branding<br>You can build a website with limited features. During the making of website, they remind you of some cool features that you can use if you had their "Premium" plan. Even after you can continue to host it and attach your own domain, but they will add their branding and back-links to their main website in your sites footer, sidebar or anywhere others can see.<br><br></li>
<li>Limited bandwidth, requests per month, number of pages and many more limitations.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1dgi6aajf0"> Then how can I build and run my own website for free?</h4>
<p>First lets see the ingredients you want to run the website.</p>
<ol>
<li>Website builder (If you don't know coding or don't want, instead want to focus more on content and business)</li>
<li>Domain name</li>
<li>Hosting</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have all of the above 3 for free of charge, then you have a free website. Now I will explain each of the above in details. Actually there are many ways to obtain each of that. But here I'm explaining a working and proven method with tools that I have personally tried and <span style="font-weight: 400;">successfully </span>published a website.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dgi6sl381">Free website builder</h2>
<p>There are many free website builders, some are online and some are offline to install and run on your computer. Out of many free website builders that I have tried, I found that <a href="https://getpublii.com" title="Open-Source CMS for Static Site" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Publii </a>is the most <span style="font-weight: 400;">promising </span>software. It supports MacOs, Windows and Linux computers. Also It is a fully open source and free software that you can install without any doubt. So go ahead, download it from this link. <a href="https://getpublii.com/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Download Publii">Download Publii</a>. When the download is complete double-click on the downloaded file to run the installer.<br><br>Once the installation is done, Publii will start automatically. For future use, a shortcut will be added to the desktop if you're using Windows, or to the Launchpad on Mac so you'll have easy access to Publii next time around. When Publii is launched for the first time you can see the following screen, where you can setup your website that we are going to launch for FREE.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/creating-new-website.svg" alt="Create Your First Website" width="748" height="498.906"></p>
<p>Select an icon, website name (this is not the domain name) and author name to start the creation of the website. Then you can select a theme from the settings menu, after that you are ready to create articles or posts. Just go through the software and I'm pretty sure you will catch up with its features quickly. It is a neatly designed software with non tech users in mind; you can always refer to <a href="https://getpublii.com/docs/" title="Publii's documentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Publii's documentation</a> which covers almost all the things it can do in simple terms.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dgkorn7d0">Free hosting for the website</h2>
<p>Now we need some place to host our website. There are many free hosting providers supported by Publii including Github pages, Amazon S3, Google cloud, Gitlab. But my favourite is <a href="https://www.netlify.com" title="Netlify: All-in-one platform for automating modern web projects">Netlify</a>. Even though they have pricing for some premium plans, their free plan is more than enough for our website.</p>
<p><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/pricing.PNG" alt="Netlify pricing" width="1147" height="656"></p>
<ol>
<li>First thing is signing up. Go to <a href="https://app.netlify.com/signup">https://app.netlify.com/signup</a> and create an account. Once you created the account, login to Netlify. Now you'll see the <strong>Your Sites</strong> screen, which should be empty since we haven't created a site yet!<br><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/netlify-dashboard-md.png" alt="" width="748" height="272"></li>
<li>Until we create our real website, it is required to create a dummy website in Netlify, so we can continue with our other configurations. Publii provides a sample website (which only contains an empty page) for this purpose. Download it from this <a href="https://cdn.getpublii.com/others/index.html.zip" title="Sample website">link</a> and drag and drop this zip file to Netlify's <strong>Your Sites</strong> screen. Now Netlify will create a site for you.</li>
<li>Now click on the site's name to go inside its settings, you will see a subdomain like in the picture below. Copy that link and paste in a notepad.<br><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/netlify-website-settings-md.png" alt="" width="748" height="422"></li>
<li>Click on <strong>Site Settings</strong> button, then scroll little bit down to see something like below. Copy that <strong>API ID</strong> and paste it in a notepad. We will need it later.<br><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/netlify-site-id-md.png" alt="" width="748" height="241"></li>
<li>Now click on your profile icon on the upper right corner, then click on <strong>User settings</strong>.</li>
<li>Scroll down to <strong>New access token</strong> button and click on it.<br><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/new-token.PNG" alt="" width="1273" height="500"></li>
<li>Give a name and click <strong>Generate token</strong>. Netlify will give you a long random character token. Copy this and keep it in the same notepad like before.<br><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/generate-token.PNG" alt="" width="917" height="476"><br><br>We are done for the moment with Netlify. Now let's go and grab a free domain.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dgi8mo7t0">Free domain name</h2>
<p>This is one of the hardest to find for free. But as I promised in the start of the article, I will show the correct way to obtain a free domain.</p>
<p>There is a service offering FREE domain names for anyone. Not only one but 5 Top Level Domain names. That service is <a href="http://www.freenom.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="freenom - A Name for Everyone">freenom</a>. They offer .TK / .ML / .GA / .CF / .GQ domain names free for unlimited period of time !!!</p>
<div class="gallery"   >

</div>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">Freenom is the world's first and only free domain provider. Our mission is to bring people online and help countries develop their digital economy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the freenom website from this link <a href="https://www.freenom.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="freenom">https://www.freenom.com</a>, then search for your required domain name. Pick one (or all) of the domain names and click on "Get it now" button(s). Finally click <strong>Checkout</strong>.<br><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/freenom.PNG" alt="Freenom domain search" width="1347" height="651"></li>
<li>Now click on "<strong>Forward this domain</strong>" button and paste the website url you copied from Nelify (in step 3) to the text box. Also select the period as 12 Months. That is the maximum allowed period for one time. But don't worry, you can again renew it before it expires for another 12 months.<br><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/netlify-4.PNG" alt="Forward domain" width="1144" height="528"></li>
<li>In the next screen, enter your email address and follow the registration process. Then you will have your new domain ready.<br><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/freenom-checkout.PNG" alt="Register domain" width="1183" height="564"></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dgksec321">Wiring it all together</h2>
<p>Now we need to connect everything together; Domain to hosting, hosting to Publii, Publii to domain. Then you will have your site ready. Follow me with the final steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Publii and click on the Server option in the left-sidebar to open the Server Settings screen.</li>
<li>Set the domain as what you have registered from Freenom.</li>
<li>From Protocol dropdown, select Netlify</li>
<li>Enter the API ID (copied at step 4 of Netlify registration) of your Netlify site into the Site ID field.</li>
<li>Enter the Netlify token we created (at step 5) in the Netlify token field, and click the Save settings button to save changes.<br><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/netlify-static-website-configuration.svg" alt="Publii configurations" width="748" height="392.832"></li>
<li>Now click on the <strong>Test connection</strong> button to see if everything is working. If that's ok you can start creating your website. </li>
<li>Once you are done with creating some posts, click on <strong>Sync your website</strong> button to publish the site. It will take some time. Once the Publii shows it's done, hit your domain name on browser and see your zero cent website !!!.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's all folks. But there are many things you can do with Publii / Netlify / Freenom combination. I will later post on how to do other configurations like proper dns configurations, forwarding www domain, Enabling Google analytics, Google ad sense and many more. This post is a starter guide for anyone to start with their own site without spending money. Share this article if you found it useful. </p>

Previous article <a href="https://devreads.xyz/how-to-build-an-api-gateway-with-netflix-zuul-spring-boot/" title="How to build an API-Gateway with Netflix Zuul + Spring Boot">How to build an API-Gateway with Netflix Zuul + Spring Boot</a></p>
<p>When it comes to API Gateways, it is important to keep your services under the load they can bear. This can be done in two ways.</p>

<ol>
<li>Scale the services and balance load.</li>
<li>Limit the rate of requests.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of the above features are possible to implement with API Gateways, but in this article we are discussing about the later. Most surprisingly, <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/zuul" title="Netflix Zuul" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix Zuul</a> official documentation does not cover how to implement rate limiting.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1dg5j85q40">How to add rate limiting to Zuul</h3>
<p>We found an awesome library called <a href="https://github.com/marcosbarbero/spring-cloud-zuul-ratelimit" title="spring cloud zuul ratelimit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spring-cloud-zuul-ratelimit</a> which you can use to easily implement rate limiting in your Spring boot application. There are six rate limiting stratergies supported by this library.</p>
<table class="responsive">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Authenticated User</td>
<td>Uses the authenticated username or 'anonymous'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Request Origin</td>
<td>Uses the user origin request</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>URL</td>
<td>Uses the request path of the downstream service</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ROLE</td>
<td>Uses the authenticated user roles</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Request method</td>
<td>Uses the HTTP request method</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Global configuration per service</td>
<td>This one does not validate the request Origin, Authenticated User or URI.<br>To use this approach just don’t set param 'type'</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">It is also possible to combine Authenticated User, Request Origin, URL, ROLE and Request Method just adding multiple values to the list.</p>
<p>To start with, add the following dependency to your <code>pom</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;<span class="pl-ent">dependency</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="pl-ent">groupId</span>&gt;com.marcosbarbero.cloud&lt;/<span class="pl-ent">groupId</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="pl-ent">artifactId</span>&gt;spring-cloud-zuul-ratelimit&lt;/<span class="pl-ent">artifactId</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="pl-ent">version</span>&gt;LATEST&lt;/<span class="pl-ent">version</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span class="pl-ent">dependency</span>&gt;</code></pre>
<p> Then chose one of the following storage backends which will be used by this library to keep track of the requests.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html">In Memory</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.consul.io/">Consul</a></li>
<li><a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a></li>
<li>JDBC (using spring-data-jpa)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vladimir-bukhtoyarov/bucket4j">Bucket4j</a>
<ul>
<li>JCache</li>
<li><a href="https://hazelcast.com/">Hazelcast</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ignite.apache.org/">Ignite</a></li>
<li><a href="http://infinispan.org/">Infinispan</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending of the chosen backend, you have to add a different dependency to the pom. All the dependency information can be found in their github <a href="https://github.com/marcosbarbero/spring-cloud-zuul-ratelimit#usage" title="README" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">README</a>.</p>
<p>Then configure the rates for each endpoint that you want to control. This can be done via either <code>properties</code> file or <code>yml</code> configuration. Sample yml file can be seen below. All the supported properties can be found <a href="https://github.com/marcosbarbero/spring-cloud-zuul-ratelimit#common-application-properties" title="documentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/devreads/64953c7613ae7de59f3fdeb4f1c7eecb.js"></script>
<p>When one of the endpoints reached their configured rate limit, it will automatically respond with http error code <code><strong>429</strong> Too Many Requests</code> for subsequent requests until the rate limit comes back to the allowed range. This will prevent the underlying service from being overload in a peak time or under a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack" title="DoS attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DoS attack</a>.</p>

                    <p class="dropcap">Recently, in one of our client sites, we have observed a crunch in CPU utilization. At some random intervals, CPU went up to 100% and kept utilizing the same until restarting the application. This application is a standalone <a href="https://devreads.xyz/articles/java/">java</a> application and involves with heavy database operations. It was critical to find the issue and fixing it soon, as this CPU utilization affected other applications on the same server. So I’m going to explain the methodology that we used to find and fix this issue.</p>

This application is a standalone <a href="https://devreads.xyz/articles/java/">java</a> application and involves with heavy database operations. It was critical to find the issue and fixing it soon, as this CPU utilization affected other applications on the same server. So I’m going to explain the methodology that we used to find and fix this issue.</p>

<p><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/5/Java_high_CPU_40_80-300x157.png" alt="High CPU utilization of a process" width="300" height="157"></p>
<p class="msg msg--info">Environment<br>Sun Solaris Server – 12 cores</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dfttpktn3">Finding the process</h2>
<p>We have used <code>top</code> command to get the most CPU utilizing applications. Since the server had 12 cores, it showed total CPU utilization by all cores. But once disabled the <em>Irix mode</em> (pressing ‘<strong>I</strong>’) we got the average CPU per process. Then obtained the PID of the most CPU utilizing the process.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>Irix/Solaris_Mode_toggle</strong><br>When operating in 'Solaris mode' ('I' toggled Off), a task's CPU usage will be divided by the total number of CPUs. After issuing this command, you'll be informed of the new state of this toggle.</p>
<p><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/5/Process-cpu-utilization-768x115.jpg" alt="&quot;top&quot; command to find high CPU process" width="768" height="115"></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dfttseju4">Finding the thread</h2>
<p>Once the PID of the process is obtained, used ‘<strong>H</strong>’ key to list the threads of that process. Then obtained the <em>NID</em> or ‘<em>Soft process Id</em>’ from the first column.</p>
<p><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/5/thread-wise-cpu-utilization-768x88.jpg" alt="FInd the process ID" width="768" height="88"></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dfttsnh75">Get the thread dump</h2>
<p>Used the following command to obtain a thread dump of the JVM process identified in step 1.</p>
<p><code>jstack -l PID &gt; jstack.txt</code></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dftttgns6">Isolate the stack trace</h2>
<p>Inside the thread dump file, it had the stack trace of each thread. But most important thing is identifying the correct stack trace. For each stack trace, there was a <em>NID </em>field in HEX format which is equivalent to the thread id obtained in step 2. Once the thread id is <a href="https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">converted to HEX</a>, we have isolated the stack trace.</p>
<p><img class="post__image--center" src="https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/5/stack-trace-768x242.jpg" alt="Isolate the stack trace" width="768" height="242"></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dftttqht7">Find the culprit code block</h2>
<p>From the stack trace, we have identified the code block which was executed with 100% CPU. In our case, it was a while loop which entered into an infinite cycle when certain condition met.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dfttu35o8">Fix it!</h2>
<p>So we have fixed that, tested and deployed to production. Now the JVM process is running smoothly even CPU doesn’t know that 🙂</p>
