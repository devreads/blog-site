So we did some research and actually found a candidate. Follow this article to find the best mobile app builder in 2019 to launch your next awesome app.</p>\n\n<p>Bite this. Here we are throwing the secret right away :)</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: We are not affiliated with this company in anyway or won't get any kind of revenue (but we would like to 😊) by sharing this app. We just ❤️ the idea behind this and totally impressed after trying it ourselves.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.glideapps.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Glide - Amazing apps from Google sheets</a></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_MEmyCRBbXM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dh9mn4la0\">Zero Code</h2>\n<p>With Glide, you don't have to write a single code for creating a mobile app. That is a great advantage for start-up founders who does not have much coding knowledge, but having an awesome idea for an app. </p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dh9n9mud3\">No Database</h2>\n<p>Best feature of Glide is, it does not require a complex database system to store app's data. Instead it uses <a href=\"https://sheets.google.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google sheets</a> so anyone having a Google account can link a sheet to the app. Then just insert some data to the sheet and it will magically appear in the mobile app. This is a huge advantage for non techie users.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dh9ngvhf4\">Ready made app templates</h2>\n<p>Glide app comes with about a dozen templates that you can use right away. Those are <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">beautifully </span>crafted for the best user experience and easy customization. Just pick an app template and click on the Copy app button to get a copy of that to your workspace. Few of those templates are a Directory app, City guide app, CRM app, budget planner and even a personal Instagram app. </p>\n<p>If the provided samples are not enough, there is a separate page showcasing apps made with glide <em><strong><a href=\"https://www.glideapps.com/madewithglide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#madewithglide</a></strong></em>.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery\"   >\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/8/gallery/template-1.PNG\" ><img src=\"https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/8/gallery/template-1-thumbnail.PNG\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"599\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/8/gallery/template-2.PNG\" ><img src=\"https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/8/gallery/template-2-thumbnail.PNG\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"590\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/8/gallery/template-3.PNG\" ><img src=\"https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/8/gallery/template-3-thumbnail.PNG\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"587\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/8/gallery/template-4.PNG\" ><img src=\"https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/8/gallery/template-4-thumbnail.PNG\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"586\"></a></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dh9mo5b81\">Progressive web app (PWA)</h2>\n<p>If you haven't heard of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PWA or Progressive Web Apps</a>, it's kind of a web site with some added features which can give you almost the same feeling as a native app when accessed through a mobile phone browser.

So you can share the app url right away with the users. But if you want to use your own url, then you have to pay and subscribe to their pro plan.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/8/pricing.PNG\" alt=\"\" width=\"717\" height=\"501\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dh9ob6cj1\">Great documentation</h2>\n<p>What impressed us most (next to Google sheet integration) was their <a href=\"https://www.glideapps.com/learn-to-glide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">documentation</a>. It has a large collection of video clips showing how to get things done with Glide. That's quite useful for newbies who doesn't have much technical knowledge to browse through tech documentation. But there is also a detailed documentation wiki available for anyone who wants to try their advanced features right inside the workspace. </p>\n<p>So that's our guide for the best free app builder found recently in response to our user requests.

They present you with a feature rich and easy to use website builder. Once you build a website, you can even host it for free and they give a domain name too. But that domain name is not a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"TLD (Top Level Domain)\">TLD (Top Level Domain)</a>. Instead a subdomain under their brand. If you want to connect a custom domain, then you have to pay.<br><br></li>\n<li>Build the website for free, but hosting is not free.<br>These services allow you to create a website quickly but then you have to subscribe to one of their plans to host your site. Otherwise you can just download your site and host somewhere else.<br><br></li>\n<li>Limited features or website with their branding<br>You can build a website with limited features. During the making of website, they remind you of some cool features that you can use if you had their \"Premium\" plan. Even after you can continue to host it and attach your own domain, but they will add their branding and back-links to their main website in your sites footer, sidebar or anywhere others can see.<br><br></li>\n<li>Limited bandwidth, requests per month, number of pages and many more limitations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1dgi6aajf0\"> Then how can I build and run my own website for free?</h4>\n<p>First lets see the ingredients you want to run the website.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Website builder (If you don't know coding or don't want, instead want to focus more on content and business)</li>\n<li>Domain name</li>\n<li>Hosting</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once you have all of the above 3 for free of charge, then you have a free website. Now I will explain each of the above in details. Actually there are many ways to obtain each of that. But here I'm explaining a working and proven method with tools that I have personally tried and <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">successfully </span>published a website.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dgi6sl381\">Free website builder</h2>\n<p>There are many free website builders, some are online and some are offline to install and run on your computer. Out of many free website builders that I have tried, I found that <a href=\"https://getpublii.com\" title=\"Open-Source CMS for Static Site\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Publii </a>is the most <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">promising </span>software. It supports MacOs, Windows and Linux computers. Also It is a fully open source and free software that you can install without any doubt. So go ahead, download it from this link. <a href=\"https://getpublii.com/download/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Download Publii\">Download Publii</a>. When the download is complete double-click on the downloaded file to run the installer.<br><br>Once the installation is done, Publii will start automatically. For future use, a shortcut will be added to the desktop if you're using Windows, or to the Launchpad on Mac so you'll have easy access to Publii next time around. When Publii is launched for the first time you can see the following screen, where you can setup your website that we are going to launch for FREE.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image\" src=\"https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/creating-new-website.svg\" alt=\"Create Your First Website\" width=\"748\" height=\"498.906\"></p>\n<p>Select an icon, website name (this is not the domain name) and author name to start the creation of the website. Then you can select a theme from the settings menu, after that you are ready to create articles or posts. Just go through the software and I'm pretty sure you will catch up with its features quickly. It is a neatly designed software with non tech users in mind; you can always refer to <a href=\"https://getpublii.com/docs/\" title=\"Publii's documentation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Publii's documentation</a> which covers almost all the things it can do in simple terms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dgkorn7d0\">Free hosting for the website</h2>\n<p>Now we need some place to host our website. There are many free hosting providers supported by Publii including Github pages, Amazon S3, Google cloud, Gitlab. But my favourite is <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com\" title=\"Netlify: All-in-one platform for automating modern web projects\">Netlify</a>.

Now you'll see the <strong>Your Sites</strong> screen, which should be empty since we haven't created a site yet!<br><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/netlify-dashboard-md.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"272\"></li>\n<li>Until we create our real website, it is required to create a dummy website in Netlify, so we can continue with our other configurations. Publii provides a sample website (which only contains an empty page) for this purpose. Download it from this <a href=\"https://cdn.getpublii.com/others/index.html.zip\" title=\"Sample website\">link</a> and drag and drop this zip file to Netlify's <strong>Your Sites</strong> screen. Now Netlify will create a site for you.</li>\n<li>Now click on the site's name to go inside its settings, you will see a subdomain like in the picture below.

Then you will have your site ready. Follow me with the final steps.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Publii and click on the Server option in the left-sidebar to open the Server Settings screen.</li>\n<li>Set the domain as what you have registered from Freenom.</li>\n<li>From Protocol dropdown, select Netlify</li>\n<li>Enter the API ID (copied at step 4 of Netlify registration) of your Netlify site into the Site ID field.</li>\n<li>Enter the Netlify token we created (at step 5) in the Netlify token field, and click the Save settings button to save changes.<br><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/7/netlify-static-website-configuration.svg\" alt=\"Publii configurations\" width=\"748\" height=\"392.832\"></li>\n<li>Now click on the <strong>Test connection</strong> button to see if everything is working. If that's ok you can start creating your website. </li>\n<li>Once you are done with creating some posts, click on <strong>Sync your website</strong> button to publish the site. It will take some time. Once the Publii shows it's done, hit your domain name on browser and see your zero cent website !!!.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That's all folks. But there are many things you can do with Publii / Netlify / Freenom combination. I will later post on how to do other configurations like proper dns configurations, forwarding www domain, Enabling Google analytics, Google ad sense and many more. This post is a starter guide for anyone to start with their own site without spending money.

Most surprisingly, <a href=\"https://github.com/Netflix/zuul\" title=\"Netflix Zuul\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Netflix Zuul</a> official documentation does not cover how to implement rate limiting.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1dg5j85q40\">How to add rate limiting to Zuul</h3>\n<p>We found an awesome library called <a href=\"https://github.com/marcosbarbero/spring-cloud-zuul-ratelimit\" title=\"spring cloud zuul ratelimit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spring-cloud-zuul-ratelimit</a> which you can use to easily implement rate limiting in your Spring boot application. There are six rate limiting stratergies supported by this library.</p>\n<table class=\"responsive\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Authenticated User</td>\n<td>Uses the authenticated username or 'anonymous'</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Request Origin</td>\n<td>Uses the user origin request</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>URL</td>\n<td>Uses the request path of the downstream service</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ROLE</td>\n<td>Uses the authenticated user roles</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Request method</td>\n<td>Uses the HTTP request method</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Global configuration per service</td>\n<td>This one does not validate the request Origin, Authenticated User or URI.<br>To use this approach just don’t set param 'type'</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">It is also possible to combine Authenticated User, Request Origin, URL, ROLE and Request Method just adding multiple values to the list.</p>\n<p>To start with, add the following dependency to your <code>pom</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-xml\">&lt;<span class=\"pl-ent\">dependency</span>&gt;\n    &lt;<span class=\"pl-ent\">groupId</span>&gt;com.marcosbarbero.cloud&lt;/<span class=\"pl-ent\">groupId</span>&gt;\n    &lt;<span class=\"pl-ent\">artifactId</span>&gt;spring-cloud-zuul-ratelimit&lt;/<span class=\"pl-ent\">artifactId</span>&gt;\n    &lt;<span class=\"pl-ent\">version</span>&gt;LATEST&lt;/<span class=\"pl-ent\">version</span>&gt;\n&lt;/<span class=\"pl-ent\">dependency</span>&gt;</code></pre>\n<p> Then chose one of the following storage backends which will be used by this library to keep track of the requests.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html\">In Memory</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.consul.io/\">Consul</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redis.io/\">Redis</a></li>\n<li>JDBC (using spring-data-jpa)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/vladimir-bukhtoyarov/bucket4j\">Bucket4j</a>\n<ul>\n<li>JCache</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hazelcast.com/\">Hazelcast</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ignite.apache.org/\">Ignite</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://infinispan.org/\">Infinispan</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending of the chosen backend, you have to add a different dependency to the pom. All the dependency information can be found in their github <a href=\"https://github.com/marcosbarbero/spring-cloud-zuul-ratelimit#usage\" title=\"README\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">README</a>.</p>\n<p>Then configure the rates for each endpoint that you want to control. This can be done via either <code>properties</code> file or <code>yml</code> configuration. Sample yml file can be seen below. All the supported properties can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/marcosbarbero/spring-cloud-zuul-ratelimit#common-application-properties\" title=\"documentation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/devreads/64953c7613ae7de59f3fdeb4f1c7eecb.js\"></script>\n<p>When one of the endpoints reached their configured rate limit, it will automatically respond with http error code <code><strong>429</strong> Too Many Requests</code> for subsequent requests until the rate limit comes back to the allowed range. This will prevent the underlying service from being overload in a peak time or under a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack\" title=\"DoS attack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DoS attack</a>.</p>",

Doing this with a general purpose load balancer like nginx or apache was the practice before. But it will take some control away from the application.

Let's start with an example.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/3/microservice.png\" alt=\"Microservice architecture\" width=\"1355\" height=\"375\"></p>\n<p>Here we have multiple services executing their own business logic, so it is up to the <strong>Gateway</strong> to send requests to the correct microservice. This <strong>Gateway</strong> is a layer 7 load balancer which routes requests to the correct microservice based on the information presented in the request url.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Layer 4 load balancer bases the load-balancing decision on the source and destination IP addresses and ports recorded in the packet header, without considering the contents of the packet.</p>\n<p>Layer 7 load balancers base their routing decisions on various characteristics of the HTTP header and on the actual contents of the message, such as the URL, the type of data (text, video, graphics), or information in a cookie.</p>\n<p>-- <a href=\"https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/layer-4-load-balancing/\" title=\"Layer 4 vs Layer 7 load balancing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nginx</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1dfnd20si0\">Netflix Zuul to the rescue </h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Netflix/zuul/wiki\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zuul </a>is a library developed by Netflix, that provides dynamic routing, monitoring, resiliency, security, and more amazing features. Best thing is Spring Boot has already bundled Zuul with their Spring Cloud dependency. Lets see how we can implement our own API Gateway with <strong>Spring Cloud + Zuul</strong>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Generate the Spring Boot project. Go to <a href=\"https://start.spring.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Spring Initializer page\">Spring Initializer page</a> and add Zuul as a dependency.</li>\n<li style=\"list-style: none;\"><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://devreads.xyz/media/posts/3/spring.png\" alt=\"Generating Spring Boot project\" width=\"1156\" height=\"688\"></li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Download and extract the project.</li>\n<li>You just need to add <code>@EnableZuulProxy</code> annotation to the Main class to make this project a Zuul proxy server. Spring Boot will auto configure everything based on this annotation.</li>\n<li style=\"list-style: none;\">\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/devreads/58a71a9bfd672dadc4fdd97113f0c01d.js\"></script>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Now you can configure routing (i.e. Request paths and respective service urls) in the application.properties file.</li>\n<li style=\"list-style: none;\">\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/devreads/79b4ad3b8d3d1891243fa8c5d392d393.js\"></script>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Execute <code>mvn clean install</code> to build the project. Then run it using <code>java –jar &lt;JARFILE&gt;</code>. You will see the API-Gateway is starting to listen on port 8080.</li>\n<li>Send two requests to <code>http://localhost:8080/api/service_1/</code> and <code>http://localhost:8080/api/service_2/</code>, you will see requests are routed to service_1 and service_2 respectively as we have configured on application.properties file.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Did you see how awesome the Spring Boot and Zuul is, that we can configure an API-Gateway application with just one annotation and couple of configuration entries.</p>\n<p>Next article of this series: <a href=\"https://devreads.xyz/implement-rate-limiting-for-api-gateways-with-spring-boot-zuul/\" title=\"Implement rate limiting for API Gateways with Spring boot + Zuul\">Implement rate limiting for API Gateways with Spring boot + Zuul</a></p>",
